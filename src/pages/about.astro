    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am from Nittedal in Norway, currently in my 2nd year studying Informatics: Computer Technology in Bergen.

      Here is a recap of my most recent years!

        <hr>
        <p>This year I started studying Informatics: Computer Technology, after an internal transfer from Cognitive Science one semester into my studies. 
          This is a choice I am satisfied with, with Computer Technology being a field of study I am really interested in. Spring exams in my new studies went well,
          getting top grades on all three exams. After a summer spent traveling across Spain and working at Posten, I have now started my 3rd semester at university.
          This fall, I have really settled down in Bergen, getting a job as a student assistant in the course Intro to Programming and joining the student organization friByte, 
          where we offer IT and web services for other student organizations in Bergen. I am currently preparing for the fall exam season, looking forward to the winter break!</p>

        <h2>2023</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>At the start of 2023, I took a break after completing a year of Compulsory Service in the Norwegian Armed Forces. I spent time in the mountains and got obsessed with XC skiing, 
          logging 1000km on Strava this winter season! On March 1st, I started working at Equipo, a small lift- and construction machine rental company with only two other employees. This was a really 
          rewarding job, with lots of challenges and responsibility. With a machine park worth 30 million NOK, there was plenty of heavy machinery to maintain. I learned a lot on the job,
          handling new issues daily.
          
          I really enjoyed my time at Equipo, but I decided to start at university in the fall, which was a tough decision but one that I am happy I made. 
          I started a bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Bergen in fall 2023. A variety of interesting courses and the possibility of specializing in Information Technology 
          or Informatics drew me to Cognitive Science. However, I eventually realized that Informatics was my true passion. I applied for an internal transfer to Computer Technology, and luckily, 
          I was approved to start directly in the 2nd semester without losing a year of study.</p>

        <h2>2022</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I spent the entirety of 2022 in Skjold Camp, Indre Troms, doing my year of Compulsory Service in the Norwegian Army. I served as a Machine Gunner in the 2nd Battalion, handling an M2 Browning, 
          also known as "12.7 Mitraljøse" mounted on a belt wagon. This year was one of personal growth, spent mostly outdoors in rough conditions. A typical week involved preparing equipment on Monday, 
          field exercises from Tuesday to Thursday, and maintenance on Friday. There were also many non-typical weeks, including extended exercises lasting up to 14 days in the field.
          Despite the challenges, I appreciated the experience, especially the physical activities like marching and shooting!</p>

        <h2>2021</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In 2021, I got my first job at Pizzabakeren. It was a great first job, where I gained experience as a pizza chef, delivery driver, and cashier. In June 2021, I graduated from high school, 
          completing 13 years of schooling! I continued working at Pizzabakeren over the summer but started a new job at Posten's Østlandsterminalen warehouse as I wanted to transition to daytime shifts.
          Working at Posten was a fantastic experience, allowing me to work in a professional setting as a 19-year-old while meeting colleagues from all walks of life. The rest of the fall was spent 
          working, running, and lifting weights in preparation for my military service, which started in January 2022.</p>
